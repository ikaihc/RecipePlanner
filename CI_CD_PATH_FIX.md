# CI/CD Path Fix - Composer.json Not Found

## 🐛 Issue Identified

### Problem
GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline was failing with the error:
```
Composer could not find a composer.json file in /home/runner/work/RecipePlanner/RecipePlanner
```

### Root Cause
The GitHub Actions workflow was running composer commands in the wrong directory. The workflow was executing commands in the project root (`/home/runner/work/RecipePlanner/RecipePlanner`) instead of the backend directory where `composer.json` is located.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Fixed Commands
All backend-related commands now include `cd backend` to ensure they run in the correct directory:

#### Before (Broken)
```yaml
- name: Install Dependencies
  run: composer install --no-ansi --no-interaction --no-scripts --prefer-dist

- name: Generate key
  run: php artisan key:generate

- name: Execute tests
  run: vendor/bin/phpunit
```

#### After (Fixed)
```yaml
- name: Install Dependencies
  run: |
    cd backend
    composer install --no-ansi --no-interaction --no-scripts --prefer-dist
    composer dump-autoload

- name: Generate key
  run: |
    cd backend
    php artisan key:generate

- name: Execute tests
  run: |
    cd backend
    vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. backend-tests Job
- ✅ **Install Dependencies**: Added `cd backend`
- ✅ **Generate key**: Added `cd backend`
- ✅ **Directory Permissions**: Added `cd backend`
- ✅ **Create Database**: Added `cd backend`
- ✅ **Execute tests**: Added `cd backend`

### 2. security-check Job
- ✅ **Install Dependencies**: Added `cd backend`
- ✅ **Run Security Check**: Added `cd backend`

### 3. code-quality Job
- ✅ **Install Dependencies**: Added `cd backend`
- ✅ **Run PHP CS Fixer**: Added `cd backend`

### GitHub Actions Working Directory
- **Checkout Location**: `/home/runner/work/RecipePlanner/RecipePlanner`
- **Backend Location**: `/home/runner/work/RecipePlanner/RecipePlanner/backend`
- **Frontend Location**: `/home/runner/work/RecipePlanner/RecipePlanner/frontend`

## 🧪 Expected Results

### After Fix
- ✅ **backend-tests**: Should pass all PHP tests
- ✅ **security-check**: Should complete composer audit
- ✅ **code-quality**: Should run PHP CS Fixer
- ✅ **frontend-tests**: Already passing (no changes needed)

### Pipeline Status
```
✅ frontend-tests (12s) - Already working
✅ backend-tests (34s) - Should now pass
✅ security-check (7s) - Should now pass  
✅ code-quality (11s) - Should now pass
```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### 1. Check GitHub Actions
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Verify latest commit shows all green checks
4. Check individual job logs for success

### 2. Verify Commands
All backend commands should now show:
```
cd backend
composer install --no-ansi --no-interaction --no-scripts --prefer-dist
```

Instead of the previous error:
```
Composer could not find a composer.json file
```

## 📋 Commands Fixed

### Composer Commands
- ✅ `composer install`
- ✅ `composer dump-autoload`
- ✅ `composer audit`

### PHP Commands
- ✅ `php artisan key:generate`
- ✅ `php artisan migrate`
- ✅ `vendor/bin/phpunit`
- ✅ `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer`

### File Operations
- ✅ `chmod -R 777 storage bootstrap/cache`
- ✅ `mkdir -p database`
- ✅ `touch database/database.sqlite`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Monitor Pipeline**: Watch for successful completion
2. **Verify All Jobs**: Ensure all 4 jobs pass
3. **Check Logs**: Review detailed logs for any remaining issues

### Future Improvements
1. **Add Working Directory**: Consider using `working-directory` in YAML
2. **Optimize Commands**: Combine related commands where possible
3. **Add Caching**: Implement composer cache for faster builds

## 📊 Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ 3 failing jobs (backend-tests, security-check, code-quality)
- ❌ Composer path errors
- ❌ Pipeline blocked

### After Fix
- ✅ All jobs should pass
- ✅ Correct working directories
- ✅ Successful CI/CD pipeline

---

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and pushed to GitHub
**Expected Result**: All CI/CD jobs should now pass
**Next Action**: Monitor GitHub Actions for successful completion
